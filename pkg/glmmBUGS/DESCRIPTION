Description: Automates running Generalized Linear Mixed Models, including
    spatial models, with WinBUGS, OpenBUGS and JAGS. Models are specified with
    formulas, with the package writings model files, arranging unbalanced data
    in ragged arrays, and creating starting values. The model is re-parameterized,
    and functions are provided for converting model outputs to the original
    parameterization.
